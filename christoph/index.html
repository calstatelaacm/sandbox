    <h2>About me:</h2>
    <p>
      A true California boy at heart, if I had to pick two things I love and enjoy the most, without a doubt they would be exploring the great outdoors and working on programming projects with friends and colleagues. One of my passions and skills is interacting with others along with teaching; you could call me a social butterfly. In my free time I enjoy playing beach volleyball and hiking.

      I have one year left at Cal State L.A. as a computer science student. I am pursuing my computer science bachelor's degree. To get to know me better check out my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/christoph-anderson/6b/953/48b">LinkedIn</a>.
